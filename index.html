             <p class="paragraph2">This yearâ€™s annual conference will be unlike anything it was before. With the recommendations from previous years we have been able to extend into many different areas of information technology. Instructors for each workshop are not only highly skilled within their prospective areas but have also been hand-selected by our staff. Upon registration, you will notice that now we are offering workshops in networking, but also web-programming, cyber security, server administration, and many more. We are VERY excited to see all of you next year! Please make sure you reserve your seats soon, slots are filling up fast!</p>
